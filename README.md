# IADS 2021-22 Algorithm and Data structure collection

To contribute please make a new branch and make a pull request! Code will only be accepted in python, and please make sure to use type annotations when possible.
Current algorithms and data structures in repo:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
- Quick Sort
- BFS
- DFS
- Dijkstra (borrowed from https://stackabuse.com/dijkstras-algorithm-in-python/)
- Floyd-Warshall (Including backtracking)
- Seam-Carving
- Coin Counting 
- Viterbi Algorithm (Including backtracking)
- Edit Distance (with string reconstruct borrowed from published solution)
- CYK
- LL(1)

Furthermore, an implementation for the Max-Heap presented in the lectures can be found here: https://github.com/when-q/Heap

## Dependancies. 
We use poetry for dependancy management, however the only package in use at the moment is pandas. Make sure to install it if you want CYK to work!
